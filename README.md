Welcome to the Olaprep Website repository! In this project, I have worked on enhancing and maintaining an educational website that provides tutors for students. As the second developer on the project, I was tasked with improving the existing codebase, which initially contained bloat and inefficiencies. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the website's functionality and user experience. Additionally, I incorporated forms to allow users to easily interact with the website. By following the steps outlined in this README, you will understand the key features and improvements made to the Olaprep Website.

## Key Features

- **Tutor Search**: The website allows students to search for tutors based on various criteria such as subject, location, availability, and expertise.

- **Tutor Profiles**: Each tutor has a dedicated profile page that includes their qualifications, experience, teaching style, and availability.

- **User Registration and Login**: Students can create an account on the website and log in to access additional features such as booking tutoring sessions and saving favorite tutors.

- **Booking and Scheduling**: Users can book tutoring sessions with their chosen tutors and manage their schedule through an intuitive interface.

- **Forms Integration**: I have added forms to the website to enhance user engagement and facilitate easy communication between students and tutors.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Olaprep Website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/UB30-4/Olaprep-site`
2. Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
3. Review the existing codebase and identify areas for improvement or optimization.
4. Enhance the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to improve the website's functionality, user experience, and performance.
5. Implement and customize the forms to suit the specific requirements of the website.
6. Test the website thoroughly to ensure that all features are working as expected.
7. Deploy the website to a hosting service or platform of your choice to make it accessible to users.

## Technologies Used

The Olaprep Website utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML: For creating the structure and content of the website.
- CSS: For styling the website, providing an appealing visual design and layout.
- JavaScript: For implementing interactivity and functionality, such as tutor search, booking, and forms integration.

## Challenges Faced

As the second developer on the project, I encountered several challenges, including:

- Understanding and refactoring existing code: Working with a bloated codebase required a deep understanding of the initial implementation and making necessary improvements while ensuring code maintainability and readability.

- Integrating forms: Implementing forms to enable seamless communication between students and tutors required careful validation, handling of form submissions, and server-side integration.

- Testing and bug fixing: Ensuring that all features functioned correctly and fixing any bugs or issues that arose during the development process was a crucial aspect of the project.
